# Lie Detection

This project aims to develop a model that is able to recognize patterns in facial expressions in order to detect whether a person that is speaking is lying or not. This is a work in progress.

The dataset is not available on this repository because it was created only for research and educational purpose and not for any commercial use. You can find all the information about it [here]("http://iab-rubric.org/resources/BagLies.html").
